Ho there knight of spade
Today you meet the gnome of Jade
Secrets I hold, many there of
My brothers youâ€™ll meet somewhere above

When struck by despair you may find this lair
Hidden like me, in a substance like tea

Remember you my brothers and I do
But it seems your memories are askew
To finish your climb, remember you must
Do your best to find those you can trust

Much time has passed since last you woke
And yet still you wear that ragged cloak
To us you are known, to most others not so
The only left may be the knights and the crow

Persevere you must, no matter the pain
Or else all this time spent will be in vain
Past wood and stone and snow and rain
You must climb this tower no matter the strain

The first of our riddles thou hath finally solved
You are on your way to being absolved
