Hrmmmm, hello there, I presume you’re here for the tower.
Simply advance onward, the base of the tower lies only a short distance ahead.
and for what it’s worth best of luck to you I suppose.

hmmmmm, you seem familiar for some reason.
Ahhh your armor seems fashioned in the ways of olde.
It has been some time since I’ve seen such impeccable craftsmanship.

It is quite curious to see another traveler so long after the rest hath arrived.
You are brave for traveling this far, but I fear it is all for naught.
Many have come before you, the greatest warriors from every land, and yet none have achieved the goal that you too now seek. 

Also please don’t mind the small fish within the pool.
He’s been here far longer than I, and it has made him quite a bitter soul.
Try not to let his words affect you.

I understand your curiosity, however I’d appreciate some time alone for now.
It’s been quite some time since I’ve been awake for this long and I had forgotten how tiring it can be.
Please allow me to rest, if you need assistance while I sleep, go forth and look for a campfire, you shall find someone there who can assist you.
